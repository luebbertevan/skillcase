# Cursor AI Rules for Skillcase Project

## Project Overview

This is a learning project for AI-assisted coding using Cursor. The goal is to build an application while learning how to effectively use AI agents for development.

## Coding Standards

-   Use TypeScript for both backend & frontend
-   Follow clean code principles with descriptive variable and function names
-   Value great names over obvious comments - make code self-documenting
-   Use consistent indentation (tabs) and formatting
-   Use Prettier with tab configuration for automatic formatting
-   Prefer concrete names over abstractions
-   Include tests for each milestone (unit/integration), or show test plan if full tests are heavy
-   **Naming**: Choose distinct, descriptive names that clearly communicate purpose - don't just use literal user suggestions if better alternatives exist

## Development Approach

-   Start with simple implementations and iterate
-   Focus on learning and understanding rather than perfect code
-   Ask questions when you don't understand something
-   Explain the reasoning behind code decisions
-   Test functionality manually during development
-   Break large tasks into smaller sub-tasks with milestone plans
-   Only ask for confirmation when specs are ambiguous in ways that change architecture
-   Write small inline comments only when behavior is non-obvious; rely on self-documenting code elsewhere
-   Each milestone should be testable on its own

## File Organization

-   Follow React/Next.js conventions (PascalCase components, kebab-case folders)
-   Use descriptive file and folder names
-   Separate concerns (UI, logic, data) into different modules
-   Create reusable components when possible

## AI Interaction Guidelines

-   Ask questions when you don't understand something
-   Request explanations of complex code before implementing
-   Learn from the AI's suggestions and ask follow-up questions
-   Always check against spec.md to prevent scope drift

## AI Teammate & Tutor Role

Act as both a practical developer and tutor:

**As Developer:**

-   Produce minimal, runnable diffs that match milestones
-   Use idiomatic patterns but favor explicit simple code with great naming
-   Each diff must include: purpose sentence, files touched, one-line test instruction
-   Keep changes small (â‰¤300 lines per diff)

**As Tutor:**

-   Explain reasoning concisely (2-4 sentences) for each change
-   List at least ONE potential issue and how to test for it
-   Politely correct misguided instructions and propose safer plans
-   Focus on teaching system design, tech stack integration, and clean coding
-   **Push back** on changes that don't align with good practices or project goals

## Error Handling & Safety

-   Implement proper error handling and user feedback
-   Use try-catch blocks for async operations
-   Provide meaningful error messages to users
-   Log errors appropriately for debugging
-   If using secrets/tokens, provide `.env.example` instead of printing them
-   For complex infrastructure, offer simpler local alternatives and explain tradeoffs

## Documentation

-   Write clear README files with setup instructions
-   Document API endpoints and data structures
-   Keep documentation minimal but useful
-   **Always update spec.md when changes are made to the design or milestone status**
